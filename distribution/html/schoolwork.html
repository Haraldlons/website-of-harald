<h1>Schoolwork</h1>
<p>
I'm currently studying <b>Electronics Systems Design and Innovation</b> at NTNU. This is a integrated full engineerings master degree of 5 years. I'm now at my fourth year and have chosen the main-profile <b>Embedded systems</b>. 
</p>
<p>
During my now completed three years I've aggregated alot of experience, and written quite many reports. I've figured, why not share them.
</p>
<p>You will at this page find reports and schoolwork which I think could be interesting for other students.</p>
