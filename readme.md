## When adding a new page and controller
1. Make a new controller by making a new file called "<pageName>Ctrl.js"
2. Copy the entire content of another controller as a template and delete what you don't need and rename what you should
3. Make a new html file by putting it in the html folder. The convention is that the filename should be "<pageName>.html" 
4. Link the new controller in the app.js. Add a ".state('<controllerName>', {..." section
5. Link the new controller in the scripts.json. Commas can easily f**k up stuff
6. Start "gulp watch" again
